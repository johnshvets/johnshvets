### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Ivan!
My stack includes React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Redux, Next.js, REST APIs, GraphQL/Apollo, Tailwind, HTML, SCSS/SASS, CSS, styled-components and Ant Design.
I have been working with React/TypeScript technologies for 3 years developing single-page applications for healthcare, e-commerce, social care, insurtech and monetization platform projects. 

My job is primarily to modify an existing design and functionality of the apps by creating new features to achieve results that business expects. 
I've been using Next.js for creating public pages of the apps and worked with vanilla HTML and PHP based frameworks.
I have experience in integrating third-party software such as Twilio, Agora, Auth0, Stripe and Ecommpay for chat, video calls, web authorization and payment system features. 

I am an easy going, open minded, goal-oriented person who is able to build a great relationship with the team. I am always open to new challenges.
